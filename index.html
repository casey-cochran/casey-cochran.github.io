								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/headshot.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>After starting my career as a Registered Nurse and being in the profession for the past 4 years, I  felt that I was missing something. I still had that lingering thought of “what if”, what if it was still possible to pursue what I wish I had always done. After long deliberation I decided to take the leap and enroll in App Academy, a software engineering bootcamp where I have had the opportunity to develop my skills in Javascript, React, Python, HTML, and CSS. Over the past 6 months I have developed a greater passion for learning software engineering and highly enjoy what I am now doing. I am excited to continuously learn and build upon my foundation to
									grow as a programmer and look forward to working with others who have the same mindset.
									 By the way, check out my <a href="#work">awesome work</a>.</p>
								<p>While learning full stack software engineering is difficult to learn within a couple years let alone 6 months, I feel that I have gained a strong foundation in these
									technologies and most importantly the ability to look up documentation and research various sources to accomplish the task at hand. With my previous work experience which relied heavily on communication,
									teamwork, and time-management, coupled together with my time at App Academy,
									I feel that I would be a strong candidate who is willing to learn and grow in this new profession.</p>

								<h3>Memories-gram</h3>
								<span class="image main"><a href='https://memories-gram.herokuapp.com/' target="_blank"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90711743/159824744-64ba89c6-800a-4b9d-a259-1c5a8a51008a.png" alt="" /></a></span>
								<p>The aim of this project is to mimick certain features of Instagram. Like Instagram this project is a social media application in which users are able to share content and view other users content. Once signed up users are directed to the home page where the feed is present that shows all the posts of other users. Not only can they view each others posts, but they are also able to comment on various posts and either like or dislike a post. Users are also able to upload their own posts as well as navigate to another user of the website and view their profile and decided whether or not they would like to follow that user.</p>
								<p>Completing this project shows my dedication to learning how to program, from starting a coding bootcamp with zero prior knowledge, to being able to build a full stack application within 2 weeks. With only two weeks to create a project with a minimum of 2 full-CRUD features, with my little experience I was able to surpass this goal by having completed both CRUD features for user posts and comments as well as adding likes, dislikes, and follows features. It was a very difficult task, but I love learning the world of programming and have enjoyed every step of the way.</p>

								<h3>Airbeanb</h3>
								<span class="image main"><a href='https://airbeanb.herokuapp.com/' target="_blank"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90711743/161163396-dbf885ab-d335-489c-bbb3-93e2011cdcaf.png" alt="" /></a></span>
								<p>This was my first solo react project in which I attempted to make a light clone of airbnb. I took most stylistic designs from airbnb themselves, but also incorporated my own design choices in certain areas of the application. While browsing this application as a user you are able to create a spot listing, edit that listing, view your listings, and delete that listing. As a user you can also view all listings made from other users and book a listing for an upcoming vacation. Even non-users are able to explore the application to an extent. They are able to view the home page as well as view all the listings, but if they try to create or book a listing, they will be prompted to signup or login.

								</p>
								<p>As my first solo project I faced a lot of difficulties with rendering data and structuring my redux state. Given only 1 week to accomplish this project after having just learned react/redux for 2 weeks, it was definitely a challenge. It goes to show that with dedication and diligence, anyone can accomplish their goal. I hope to come back to this project in the future and continue working on new features such as incorporating reviews, search, and integegrating google maps API.</p>

								<h3>Spot-ify</h3>
								<span class="image main"><a href='https://spot-ifyy.herokuapp.com/' target="_blank"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90711743/161166216-a22d5a88-d19d-4d5b-bcc5-484c3336386d.png" alt="" /></a></span>
								<p>Spot-ify was built as a clone of Spotify. This project was worked on in collaberation with three other junior developers.
									It utilizes a slightly different stack than the others and incorporates Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy along with
									React/Redux. We built this with features such as playlists, liked songs, follows, library, search, and a music player. I specifically
									played a large part in developing the likes, follows, playlist, and search features.
								</p>
								<p>
									Creating this application helped us to gain a greater knowledge working with Python and Flask as compared to Javascript and Express.
									The majority of the bootcamp was spent learning Javascript with only 2 weeks towards the end to learn Python and Flask. Structuring it
									this way helped us to get the feel of a real world scenario in which we may have to pick up a new language or technology within a short
									amount of time. The big takeaway from this project is our ability to transfer the concepts we learned from one language
									to another very quickly and the ability to rely heavily on documentation. Lastly, we were able to gain experience working in a
									team setting as well as proper github work flow.

								<h3>Inter-medium</h3>
								<span class="image main"><a href='https://inter-medium.herokuapp.com/' target="_blank"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90711743/161167743-2aa942d9-2ac3-4327-a949-ed1238f065c3.png" alt="" /></a></span>
								<p>Inter-medium is an app centered around users sharing their hobbies with other users. This applications takes inspiration from the website Medium. Developed in collaboration with 3 other developers,
									we mimicked some aspects of Medium while creating our own twist and styling designs.
									The main goal is to allow users to share their posts and for other users to like/comment on those posts.
								</p>
								<p>
									As our very first application built within the App Academy coding bootcamp, it does not utilize as many
									technologies as my other projects. This project only uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, Express, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL.
									Also developed in a team of four developers, we worked on making a dynamic website with only DOM manipulation and
									fetch calls to our server. Struggling through this project, it helped us to understand the basics of how a full stack
									application functions and all the moving parts that must work together in unison. It took a lot of learning before we
									started our first project in the bootcamp, but after working on this one I realized that I enjoy this far more than I had
									imagined. I cherish this project as our very first project and hope to look back on it to see how far I have progressed.
